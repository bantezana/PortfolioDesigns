                    <p>1 in 6 people have sensory processing differences (autism, ADHD, anxiety, PTSD). Everyday environments such as grocery stores, malls, offices can trigger sensory overload: panic attacks, shutdowns, meltdowns. Yet there's no way to preview or prepare for a space's sensory profile before entering.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tldr-box">
                    <h3>The Solution</h3>
                    <p>An AR app that scans environments in real time, detects sensory triggers (noise, light, crowds, smells), rates spaces against the user's personal sensory profile, and provides AR guided escape routes to quiet spaces when overwhelm hits. Think Google Maps, but for sensory safety.</p>

            <h2><span class="section-icon"></span>The Invisible Disability</h2>
            <p>Sensory processing differences are invisible but debilitating. A neurotypical person walks into Target and shops. An autistic person walks into Target and is assaulted by:</p>
            
            <ul class="key-findings">
                <li>Fluorescent lights flickering at 60Hz</li>
                <li>Overlapping music, announcements, cart squeaks</li>
                <li>Chemical smells from cleaning products</li>
                <li>Visual clutter of thousands of products</li>
                <li>Unpredictable movement of crowds</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The result: panic attacks, meltdowns, or simply avoiding places entirely. <strong>40% of autistic adults report avoiding grocery shopping due to sensory overwhelm.</strong> This isn't preference it's inaccessibility.</p>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <p>"I used to have full panic attacks in grocery stores. The fluorescent lights felt like knives in my brain. I started doing all my shopping at 6am when the store was empty and quieter."</p>

            <ul class="key-findings">
                <li><strong>No Advance Information:</strong> You can't know if a restaurant will be overwhelming until you're already inside and overwhelmed</li>

                <li><strong>Accommodations are Inconsistent:</strong> "Quiet hours" at some stores, but most businesses don't understand sensory needs</li>
                <li><strong>Existing Apps Don't Use Real Time Data:</strong> Reviews say "loud" or "bright" but don't quantify or adapt to your specific sensitivities</li>

            <h3>Key Insights</h3>
            <ul class="key-findings">
                <li><strong>Everyone's Sensory Profile is Unique:</strong> One person is sensitive to sound, another to light. Solution must be personalized, not one-size-fits-all.</li>
                <li><strong>Overwhelm Builds Gradually:</strong> It's not instant panic. There's a warning period where intervention could prevent meltdown.</li>
                <li><strong>Escape Routes are Critical:</strong> When overload hits, you need to know: Where's the bathroom? Where's the exit? Where's quiet?</li>
                <li><strong>Community Knowledge Helps:</strong> "Best quiet spot in this cafe: back corner by the plants." Crowdsourced tips from other sensory sensitive people are gold.</li>
                <li><strong>Advance Warning Reduces Anxiety:</strong> Knowing a place will be challenging is better than being blindsided. Preparedness reduces stress.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The core innovation: using smartphone sensors + AR to quantify environments in real time and compare against the user's personal sensory profile.</p>

            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-top: 1rem;">
                <li><strong>Setup:</strong> User creates sensory profile (which stimuli overwhelm them)</li>
                <li><strong>Scanning:</strong> Camera + microphone scan environment (decibel level, light flicker, crowd density)</li>
                <li><strong>Matching:</strong> App compares environment to user's profile and generates compatibility score</li>
                <li><strong>Guidance:</strong> AR overlays show safe spaces or escape routes when needed</li>
            </ul>

                <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem; color: #64748b; font-size: 0.95rem;">Users set their personal sensitivity levels across 6 sensory dimensions: Auditory, Visual, Tactile, Olfactory, Proprioceptive, and Vestibular. This personalization ensures the app matches environments to their unique needs, not generic assumptions.</p>

                <h4>Why Personalized Profiles?</h4>
                <p>Sensory processing is highly individual. Designing for "the average autistic person" would serve no one.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem; color: #64748b; font-size: 0.95rem;">The AR overlay shows real-time sensory data: 68 dB sound level (yellow warning), "Crowded" density, and a fluorescent light warning. The overall rating "6/10 - Challenging for you" is personalized to the user's profile. The ? icon provides context for each metric.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>What Gets Measured</h3>
            <ul class="key-findings">
                <li><strong>Sound (Auditory):</strong> Microphone measures decibel levels and identifies overlapping noise sources</li>
                <li><strong>Light (Visual):</strong> Camera detects brightness, flicker rate of fluorescent lights, visual clutter</li>
                <li><strong>Crowd Density:</strong> Computer vision estimates number of people and movement patterns</li>
                <li><strong>Smells (Olfactory):</strong> User-reported (future: chemical sensors). Community contributes data.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Personalized Rating</h3>
            <p>Instead of generic "loud" or "bright," the app generates a personalized compatibility score:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-top: 1rem;">
                <li><strong>9-10:</strong> "Comfortable for you" (green)</li>
                <li><strong>6-8:</strong> "Challenging for you" (yellow)</li>
                <li><strong>3-5:</strong> "Difficult for you" (orange)</li>
                <li><strong>1-2:</strong> "Avoid if possible" (red)</li>

AR arrows immediately guide them to the nearest quiet space (bathroom, 32 seconds away). Alternative options are shown but dimmed. The large red button is always accessible—no menus to navigate when panicking.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
            <p>During sensory overload, cognitive function declines. You can't think clearly, process signs, or navigate complex spaces. The AR guidance removes that cognitive load.</p>

                <li><strong>Large Touch Targets:</strong> 44px minimum. Motor control can be affected during overload.</li>
                <li><strong>Simple Language:</strong> No jargon. "Crowded" not "High pedestrian density index."</li>
                <li><strong>Haptic Feedback:</strong> Vibration confirms actions without needing to look at screen.</li>
                <li><strong>Voice Control:</strong> Can activate escape route by saying "I need a break" when tapping is difficult.</li>
                <li><strong>Reduced Motion Mode:</strong> Turns off animations for users sensitive to motion.</li>

            <h2><span class="section-icon">🚧</span>Technical & Ethical Challenges</h2>
            
            <h3>Challenge 1: AR Performance in Diverse Environments</h3>
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong> AR tracking fails in very bright or very dark spaces—exactly the conditions that might be sensory triggers.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Fallback to manual input mode. If AR fails, app switches to text-based guidance ("Turn left at the food court").</p>

            <h3>Challenge 2: Privacy of Sensory Data</h3>
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Sensory profiles are sensitive medical information. How much gets shared?</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Personal profiles are private by default. When contributing to location profiles, only aggregated data is shared (never individual profiles).</p>

            <h3>Challenge 3: Not All Sensory Issues Are Measurable</h3>
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Phones can't detect smells, textures, or subtle visual triggers like patterns.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Hybrid approach—sensors for what's measurable (sound, light), community reporting for subjective factors (smells, vibe).</p>

            <h3>Challenge 4: Avoiding Ableist Language</h3>
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Early versions used medical language that felt pathologizing ("disorder," "deficit").</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Consulted with disabled advocates. Reframed as "sensory profile" not "sensory disorder." Language of difference, not deficiency.</p>

            <h2><span class="section-icon">💭</span>Reflections & Future Vision</h2>
            
            <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <ul class="key-findings">
                <li><strong>Accessibility is Innovation:</strong> Designing for neurodiverse users pushed me to create features (escape routes, personalized profiles) that benefit everyone.</li>
                <li><strong>Lived Experience is Essential:</strong> I couldn't have designed this without extensive consultation with neurodiverse individuals. They're the experts.</li>
                <li><strong>Technology Can Create Independence:</strong> Participants cried during testing because the app let them go places alone they'd previously avoided. That's life changing.</li>
                <li><strong>Small Details Matter Exponentially:</strong> The difference between 40px and 44px button size matters WAY more when someone is mid panic attack.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Future Directions</h3>
            <ul class="key-findings">
                <li><strong>Wearable Integration:</strong> Smartwatch monitors heart rate/stress and proactively suggests breaks before overload hits</li>
                <li><strong>Business Partnerships:</strong> Work with retailers to create sensory friendly hours and receive "Sensory Safe" certification</li>
                <li><strong>AI Pattern Recognition:</strong> Learn user's personal triggers over time and predict which environments will be challenging</li>
                <li><strong>Indoor Navigation:</strong> Extend AR guidance to complex indoor spaces (airports, hospitals, universities)</li>
                <li><strong>Social Features:</strong> Find sensory compatible friends for outings (both prefer quiet cafes at 9am)</li>
            </ul>

            <ul class="key-findings">
                <li><strong>Design for the Margins, Benefit the Center:</strong> Features built for neurodiverse users (advance information, escape routes, personalized profiles) help everyone. Accessible design is better design.</li>
                <li><strong>Technology as Empowerment:</strong> The right technology doesn't "fix" neurodiversity—it removes environmental barriers and creates independence.</li>
                <li><strong>Lived Experience Must Lead:</strong> No amount of research papers can replace the insights of people who live with sensory processing differences daily. Co-design is essential.</li>
                <li><strong>Invisible Disabilities Need Visible Solutions:</strong> Sensory overwhelm is real, debilitating, and deserves the same design attention as physical accessibility.</li>
                <li><strong>The Overlooked Deserve Inclusion:</strong> Neurodiverse individuals represent 15-20% of the population but are rarely centered in mainstream design. This must change.</li>
